When upgrading a Spring Boot version, ensuring that the application maintains or improves its performance is crucial. Here are specific steps for conducting performance testing after a Spring Boot version upgrade:

Pre-upgrade Preparation:
Define Performance Metrics: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.).

Choose Testing Tools: Select appropriate tools for performance testing, such as JMeter, Gatling, Apache Benchmark (ab), or specialized tools for specific metrics.

Create Test Environment: Set up a test environment resembling the production setup as closely as possible. This includes the database, server configuration, network settings, etc.

Steps for Performance Testing after Spring Boot Upgrade:
Baseline Measurement:

Run performance tests on the current version of Spring Boot to establish a baseline for comparison.
Upgrade Spring Boot Version:

Update the Spring Boot version in your application to the desired one. Ensure all dependencies, configurations, and libraries are compatible and updated accordingly.
Reconfigure & Rebuild:

Adjust any configurations that might have changed due to the upgrade. Rebuild the application to incorporate these changes.
Test Execution:

Load Testing: Simulate various loads (normal, peak, stress) on the upgraded application to evaluate its performance under different conditions.
Stress Testing: Assess how the application behaves under extreme loads, checking for breaking points or performance degradation.
Soak Testing: Run the system under a sustained load for an extended period to detect memory leaks or performance issues over time.
Monitor & Analyze:

Continuously monitor system metrics using appropriate tools during test runs. Capture data related to CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, etc.
Compare the metrics obtained after the upgrade with the baseline metrics to identify any improvements or regressions.
Identify Bottlenecks:

Analyze the data collected to identify potential bottlenecks or areas where performance has degraded post-upgrade.
Optimization & Fine-Tuning:

If performance issues are identified, optimize configurations, review code, or adjust infrastructure settings to address the bottlenecks.
Retest:

After making optimizations, re-run the tests to validate if the changes have positively impacted the performance.
Best Practices:
Isolation of Changes: Focus solely on the Spring Boot upgrade during testing to accurately assess its impact on performance.
Realistic Testing Scenarios: Use realistic data and traffic patterns to simulate actual user behavior.
Documentation: Record all test results, changes made, and their effects for future reference.
Conclusion:
Performance testing after a Spring Boot version upgrade is vital to ensure that the system remains stable, efficient, and performs optimally. It allows you to catch any performance issues introduced by the upgrade and implement necessary optimizations to maintain or enhance the application's performance.
